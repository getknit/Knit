/**
 * Short-lived, bounded, in-memory buffer of `CTL_GROUP_KEY` frames that arrived for a group we do not hold
 * yet — the seed-before-roster race. A group reaches a member as the roster on its first frame
 * (`InboundPipeline.reconcileGroup`), but the creator distributes the sender-key seed *before* that frame
 * floods (`MeshManager.sealGroupRatchet`), and custody serves the two in whatever order it likes. Adoption
 * is gated on holding the group, and the DM ratchet consumes a ctl frame whether or not its payload was
 * adopted — so without this buffer the seed lands, is discarded, and every re-serve of it is a
 * `RATCHET_DUPLICATE`; the group's first message then sits at `GROUP_RATCHET_NO_KEY` until a re-send
 * trigger the sender may never hit.
 *
 * The pipeline parks the frame here **before the ratchet commit** (the lock-free peek decides), so the
 * chain never advances past it; when the group is first reconciled, `reconcileGroup` releases the parked
 * frames and re-runs them through the deliver path, where the same open now succeeds (a later frame from
 * that sender only leaves a skipped key behind, which the replay consumes). The race's second shape parks
 * here too: a sender we hold as *departed* whose seed for the re-created group floods ahead of the frame
 * that rejoins them. That frame waits on its sender's own rejoin, not on the roster, so [release] takes a
 * predicate — the pipeline releases only what the reconciled row can now adopt, and a frame whose sender is
 * still departed stays parked (its `parkedAt` untouched) across every other member's frame, until the
 * rejoin lifts the tombstone or the TTL ages it out. Releasing it regardless would re-park it with a fresh
 * clock on every group frame, so the hold never expired and the held/replayed metrics climbed for a seed
 * that was going nowhere.
 *
 * In-memory like [PendingInbound]: the frame is already authenticated (it passed `verifyInbound`), but a
 * process restart loses nothing that custody does not still hold — the seed frame was custodied on first
 * sight and its chain was never advanced, so a re-serve after restart takes this path again. Bounded three
 * ways — a per-group cap (a roster is at most eight members, each owed a root gossip and a seed), a global
 * cap, and a [holdTtlMs] — all oldest-first. Pure (no Android/Room; injected clock), JVM-tested directly
 * (`PendingGroupKeysTest`).
