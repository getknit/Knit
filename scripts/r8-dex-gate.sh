# Guard Knit's R8 output against a keep-rule regression.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Play Console reports three numbers for every uploaded bundle — optimization rate,
# obfuscation rate and shrinking rate — and they move together, because a `-keep` blocks all three over
# whatever it matches. Knit sat at 48/48/48 until ADR 050 dropped three blanket `-keep … { *; }` rules
# (Tink, ARSCLib, apksig) that were 93% of everything R8 was forbidden to touch. The realistic way that
# regresses is not someone re-adding those lines on purpose: it is a dependency upgrade shipping a broad
# *consumer* rule, which is invisible in a diff and silent until the next Play upload months later.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. R8 full mode repackages every renamed class into the unnamed root package, so a class
# that still reports a real package name is, by definition, one a keep rule pinned. The share of dex bytes
# sitting in named top-level packages is therefore a direct read of how much of the app R8 was not allowed
# to touch — the same quantity Play scores, computed from the APK with no proto parsing and no extra
# tooling: `apkanalyzer` is already in the cmdline-tools this build installs.
#
# It is deliberately a coarse floor, not a target. Small drifts are normal (a library gains a class, a
# keep matches one more thing); the failure it is built to catch is a step change.
