/**

 * call site never has to ask — it names the motion it wants and gets nothing when the user asked for nothing.
 *
 * `static` on purpose: it changes about once in the life of a process, and a static local trades cheap reads
 * for an expensive (but effectively never taken) subtree recomposition.

/**
 * Knit's motion vocabulary — the single place that decides *how* the app moves, so call sites choose a
 * meaning ("this pops in") rather than a duration and an easing curve.
 *
 * The specs are springs, not hand-tuned `tween`s, and they keep Material 3's split between **spatial**
 * motion (something moves or resizes — underdamped, with a little follow-through) and **effects** (something
 * fades or recolours in place — critically damped, because a colour that overshoots is a different colour).
 * Borrowing that split keeps the whole app coherent for free.
 *
 * The damping and stiffness values below are M3's own *standard* motion tokens, copied rather than read from
 * `MaterialTheme.motionScheme`: that property and the `MotionScheme` type are still `internal` in Material3
 * 1.4.0 (the JVM symbols are public, but the Kotlin metadata is not), so they cannot be referenced from here
 * yet. They are the standard scheme, not the expressive one, which is louder than this app wants. When
 * `MotionScheme` goes public, these four functions are the only place that has to change.
 *
 * **Every animation in the app is finite.** An infinite transition composed on a settled screen never lets
 * Compose go idle, which times out `waitForIdle`/`waitUntil` in both the Robolectric screen tests and the
 * seeded instrumentation suite. The two that exist (the typing indicator's sweep and the chat-list skeleton's
 * pulse) are only ever composed transiently. See ADR 047.
