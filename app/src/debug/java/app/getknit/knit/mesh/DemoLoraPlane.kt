/**
 * A no-op [LoraPlaneStatus] for the demo builds: a board that is bound, connected, set up for Knit and
 * hearing other radios — reported, never dialled. It is the LoRa sibling of [DemoTransport], and it exists
 * for the same reason: an emulator has no Bluetooth adapter and no Meshtastic hardware, so without it the
 * LoRa radio screen can only ever be photographed in its empty state, and the board glyph on a chat header
 * never appears at all.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to a radio. [provisionKnitChannel] reports the channel as already present rather than
 * writing anything, so a stray tap during a capture is inert.
 *
 * Only compiled into the debug variant (`src/debug`), and only wired in when `-PseedDemo=true` — see
 * `di/DemoWiring.kt`.
