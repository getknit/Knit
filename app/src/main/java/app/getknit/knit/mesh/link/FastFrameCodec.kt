/**
 * Compact re-encoding of a fast-path [WireEnvelope] for a size-capped side channel (the Wi-Fi Aware
 * coordination-plane `sendMessage`, ~255 B/message; the planned BLE extended-advertising analogue rides
 * the same format — knit/knit-next#13). **Transport-local, not a wire change**: only the outer envelope
 * (whose `ttl`/`hops`/`relay` are unsigned, mutable routing metadata every relayer already rewrites) is
 * re-framed; [WireEnvelope.sig] and [WireEnvelope.signed] pass through **byte-for-byte**, so the
 * originator's Ed25519 signature verifies unchanged at the endpoint. Senders emit these tags only
 * toward peers advertising `Protocol.CAP_FAST_COMPACT`; everyone else keeps the legacy tagged-CBOR
 * framing, which can represent any envelope.
 *
 * Compact frame ([TAG_COMPACT]):
 * ```
 * [0]    tag 0x03
 * [1]    flags: bit0 RELAY, bit1 DEFLATED, bits2-3 dictId (1 = DICT_V1), bit4 UNSIGNED (the sig field is
 *        absent — the v3 point-to-point sealed tick, ADR 059, whose AEAD is its authenticator),
 *        bits5-7 reserved (must be 0)
 * [2]    ttl (high nibble) / hops (low nibble), each saturated at 15 — legal values are ≤ DEFAULT_TTL=8,
 *        and saturating a hostile larger value can only tighten propagation, never loosen it
 * [3]    sig, 64 raw bytes (outside the deflate stream: 64 random bytes would only poison the
 *        Huffman histogram the compressible CBOR text needs) — omitted when UNSIGNED, so `signed`
 *        starts at [3]
 * [67]   signed — verbatim (DEFLATED clear) or raw-deflate `nowrap` with the preset dict (DEFLATED set;
 *        kept only when strictly smaller, so a compact frame never out-grows its stored form)
 * ```
 *
 * Fragment ([TAG_FRAG]) — the fit guarantee for frames past one message:
 * ```
 * [0]    tag 0x04
 * [1-2]  fragId, big-endian u16 (per-sender counter; one id per frame across all fan-out targets)
 * [3]    part index (high nibble) / part count (low nibble), count in 2..MAX_PARTS
 * [4]    a consecutive slice of the COMPLETE 0x03 or 0x05 frame (its tag+header included), fixed-size
 *        chunks except the last — so reassembly yields a self-describing tagged unit fed back through
 *        [decodeCompact], and the receiver never needs to know the sender's chunk size
 * ```
 *
 * Transcoded frame ([TAG_TRANSCODED], ADR 060): the same header and sig as 0x03, but the body is
 * [FrameTranscoder]'s schema-aware re-encoding of `signed` (integer labels, raw ids and hashes, a 6-byte clock,
 * the payload inlined), which the receiver rebuilds byte-exact before the signature is verified — `signed`
 * still arrives byte-for-byte, it just does not *travel* that way. DEFLATED on 0x05 means raw deflate with
 * **no** dictionary (dictId 0 — the text tokens [DICT_V1] was built from are gone from the transcoded form).
 * A sender emits 0x05 only toward `Protocol.CAP_FRAME_TRANSCODE` peers and only when it is the smaller of the
 * two forms ([encodeBest]); a frame the transcoder cannot reproduce keeps 0x03.
 *
 * Tag registry (append-only, like capability bits): `0x01` legacy tagged-CBOR frame (forever), `0x02`
 * burned (a since-removed nudge), `0x03` compact, `0x04` fragment, `0x05` transcoded. Flag bits are append-only too: a
 * receiver drops any reserved bit it does not know, so a new bit is only ever emitted toward a peer whose
 * capabilities say it reads it (UNSIGNED rides behind `Protocol.CAP_CRYPTO_V3`). Tags stay non-printable
 * (`0x00..0x1F`) so untagged cues — whose first byte is a printable node-id char — remain
 * distinguishable. [DICT_V1] is **frozen** once shipped (pinned by a SHA-256 golden test): a receiver
 * inflating with a different dictionary yields garbage that only dies later at decode/signature, so
 * post-ship tuning mints `DICT_V2` under a fresh dictId, never edits V1.
 *
 * Pure (no Android), so the codec is JVM-unit-testable ([app.getknit.knit.FastFrameCodecTest]).

/**
 * Reassembles [FastFrameCodec.TAG_FRAG] parts back into complete compact frames, keyed by [K] (the
 * transport's per-sender identity — e.g. the Wi-Fi Aware discovery session + peer handle) plus the
 * fragment id. Single-thread-confined by contract (the Wi-Fi Aware transport touches it only on its
 * one Aware callback thread), so it needs no locking; [now] is injected so the JVM tests drive time.
 *
 * Bounded on both axes: at most [capacity] in-flight entries (inserting past it evicts the oldest —
 * [Drop.OVERFLOW]) and a lazy [timeoutMs] sweep on every insert drops stale ones ([Drop.TIMEOUT]) —
 * no timer, because the whole map is ≤ [DEFAULT_CAPACITY] × ~765 B and an orphan parks harmlessly
 * until the next insert. Duplicate parts are idempotent; a re-announced fragId with a *different*
 * part count restarts its entry (the sender wrapped or restarted); completion removes the entry, so
 * a late duplicate part starts a fresh one that simply ages out. Losses are fine by design: this
 * plane is best-effort and the flood/custody path re-carries every reliable frame.
 *
 * Pure (no Android) — JVM-unit-testable ([app.getknit.knit.FragReassemblerTest]).
