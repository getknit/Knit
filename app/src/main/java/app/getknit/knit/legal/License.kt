/**
 * The licenses Knit ships text for, each backed by a file under `assets/legal/` so a phone that got Knit
 * over Bluetooth with no Internet can still read them. Knit's own is [GPL_3_0_OR_LATER]; the rest cover
 * every row in [ThirdPartyNotices]. [spdx] is the SPDX identifier the notices table and the in-app list
 * both print; [routeId] is its lower-cased form, safe in a navigation route.
 *
 * `assets/legal/COPYING` is a byte copy of the repository's `COPYING`, pinned by `LicenseAssetsTest` —
 * committed rather than copied at build time, so the release APK stays a function of the tree alone.
