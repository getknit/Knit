 * Backs the read-only Your mesh screen from four sources that already exist for other reasons, so it can
 * never disagree with them: "nearby" is [MeshController.neighborCount] (what the header shows, ADR
 * 2026-09.2ajk), the lifetime numbers are [ContributionLedger.totals] (persisted plus what this session has
 * not banked yet, so a hand-off shows at once), "met" is the met-peers table, and "carrying now" is a live
 * `forward_store` count. Nothing here is polled from `MeshMetrics`.
 *
 * The carrying count is a Room flow, which re-emits on every custody write, but its `now` is fixed per
 * subscription; a ticker re-subscribes every [REFRESH_MS] so an expired-but-unswept row ages out of the
 * number between the 10-minute sweeps. The ticker lives inside the `stateIn`, so it stops with the screen.
