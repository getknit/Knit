/**
 * Everything the app needs to *describe* a voice note's bytes: how long it plays, and the bar heights the
 * bubble draws. Both are derived from the audio itself and stored only locally (`MessageEntity.voiceDurationMs`
 * / `voicePeaks`) — neither crosses the wire, so a voice note costs no new wire field (see
 * `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`) and an old build simply renders one as an ordinary attachment it can't decode.
 *
 * The sender derives from the bytes it just recorded; the receiver derives from the same bytes once the blob
 * lands (`InboundPipeline.onObtained`). Deriving on *both* sides from one implementation is deliberate: the
 * two ends then agree by construction rather than by a field one of them has to trust.
 *
 * Voice notes are AAC-LC in an **ADTS** stream ([MIME]), not MPEG-4. That choice is forced by ADR 029 —
 * attachment bytes must never touch disk in plaintext, `MediaRecorder`'s MPEG-4 muxer needs a *seekable*
 * sink to write its `moov` atom and so cannot target a pipe, and ADTS is a pure stream that can. The happy
 * consequence is [durationMs]: ADTS frame headers are self-describing, so the duration is exact arithmetic
 * over the frame headers with no decoder, no Android dependency, and no container metadata to trust — which
 * is also what gives [peaks] a time base, since an ADTS stream states no duration of its own.
