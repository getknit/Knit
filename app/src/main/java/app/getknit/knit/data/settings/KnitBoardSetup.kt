/**
 * A Meshtastic board set up for Knit (ADR 045): it carries the Knit channel in a secondary slot, its own
 * broadcasts are stretched, and it no longer repeats strangers' traffic.
 *
 * The values here are the board's own as they stood *before* the setup, kept so restoring can put those back
 * instead of guessing at the firmware's. A zero interval means the value was never recorded, which the
 * restore writes as "let the firmware substitute its default"; [rebroadcastMode] 0 is a real value (ALL).
 * An empty [longName] / [shortName] likewise means no name was recorded, which the restore answers with the
 * one the firmware itself would have given the board.
 *
 * Primitive by design: [SettingsStore] is a data-layer class and stays free of `mesh/` types; the LoRa
 * ViewModel maps this onto `mesh.lora.BoardSettings` at the seam.
