/**
 * Turns a stable [Identity] node id into a friendly alias — one PascalCase "AdverbAdjectiveNoun" token
 * such as `ReallyJoyfulFerret` — so a peer who hasn't set a profile name shows something human-readable
 * instead of a raw node id, and so two peers who *share* a name can be told apart by it (ADR 058,
 * `PeerLabels`).
 *
 * The alias is a word encoding of a digest of the node id: `SHA-256("knit-alias-v2:" + nodeId)` is 32
 * bytes, and each byte is a whole index into one of three frozen 256-entry word lists ([ALIAS_ADVERBS],
 * [ALIAS_ADJECTIVES], [ALIAS_NOUNS] in `AliasWords.kt`), three bytes to a token. No modulo bias, nothing
 * to re-roll, and an iOS port reproduces every alias from the salt and the lists alone. The mapping is a
 * pure, deterministic function of the node id, so **every device derives the same alias for the same node
 * id** with no extra exchange: nothing is broadcast or persisted, and the wire format / database stay
 * untouched.
 *
 * [aliasFor] is the first token — 24 bits, the alias everyone sees and quotes. The digest carries ten
 * ([MAX_TOKENS]); [phrase] exposes a longer prefix, which `PeerLabels` appends one token at a time
 * whenever two labels would otherwise read the same, so an alias ground to match a target's can only make
 * *both* labels longer, never equal (the argument and the numbers are in `PeerLabels`).
 *
 * Avoiding offensive output is a *pairwise* problem ("FatCow" is offensive even though neither word is),
 * and a byte-exact mapping cannot re-roll, so it is handled entirely in curation: the adverbs and
 * adjectives are positive/neutral only — no body, appearance, identity, or political terms — the nouns are
 * neutral (animals, nature, gems, objects), and `AliasTest` cross-checks every word and every adjacent
 * concatenation against the shipped profanity list.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin with no Android dependencies so it is unit-tested on the JVM (see `AliasTest`).
