 * would need three exclude entries that stay correct forever — and one missed entry ships crash traces
 * to cloud backup and device-to-device transfer, real egress in an app whose premise is that it has
 * none. `noBackupFilesDir` is excluded by construction and needs no XML at all.
 *
 * The cost is that `FileProvider` has no `no-backup-files-path` tag, so a stored report cannot be
 * shared directly — [CrashReports] stages a share copy under `cacheDir/crash/` instead. That is a
 * feature: the provider can only ever hand out the one report the user picked.
 *
 * This is the single definition of the path, called both from `KnitApplication.onCreate` (before Koin
 * exists) and from `appModule`, so the two cannot drift apart.
