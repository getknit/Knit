/**
 * The member-side attachment rules of `docs/SPOOL_PROTOCOL.md` §4.5/§9.5: which attachments a scope
 * carries, how one is cut into deterministically-positioned chunks and put back together, and the
 * presence bitmap a spool answers `ahave` with. Pure like [ScopeFrames] — no Android, no IO, no state
 * beyond the caller-owned [Assembly] — so the whole rule set is unit-testable against fixtures.
 *
 * Two structural properties worth stating up front, because both are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Attachments are deliberately not part of the scope digest.** Anything a digest folds over must be
 *   bounded by a rule identical on every node, and a per-scope *byte* quota is exactly the sort of
 *   operator-tunable knob that cannot be. Two spools with different attachment budgets would never
 *   converge. This is the same reason `ForwardEntity.attachmentHash` stays out of the mesh's own
 *   `StoreDigest`, and it is why presence is discovered by asking (`ahave`) rather than by anti-entropy.
 * - **Every allocation sized by a peer-supplied `total` is bounded by [MAX_CHUNKS].** A chunk header is
 *   inside the AEAD, so only a scope member can set it — but a member is exactly who a scope must
 *   survive, so the bound is enforced here rather than assumed.
