/**
 * The Internet-relay plane's state, as the UI needs it: the two settings that arm it plus a periodic
 * read of `ScopeSync`'s live per-spool status.
 *
 * Polled rather than pushed because `ScopeSync` exposes a snapshot (`status()`), not a stream, and
 * giving it one would mean threading a `MutableStateFlow` through the worker loop for a value that
 * changes on connect/disconnect and scope-table edits — never per frame. [POLL_MS] is deliberately
 * slower than the Diagnostics ticker: this feeds an ambient chat indicator, not a debug readout.
 *
 * [statuses] stays available separately because the relay settings screen and Diagnostics both want the
 * per-spool detail (url, `lastError`, per-scope counts) that [facts] flattens away.
 *
 * The flow is cold, so each collector runs its own ticker rather than sharing one. That is deliberate:
 * `spoolStatus()` is an in-memory read over a handful of workers, at most two of these screens are alive
 * at once, and sharing would mean giving a repository its own `CoroutineScope` to `shareIn` — lifecycle
 * for no measurable saving. The singleton exists to share the *derivation*, not a subscription.
