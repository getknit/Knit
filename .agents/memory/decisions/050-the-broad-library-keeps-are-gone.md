# ADR 050 — The broad library keeps are gone: R8 now optimizes 97% of the app, and the xmlpull duplication bites twice

Status: Accepted (2026-08-26)

Play Console reported Knit at **48% optimization, 48% obfuscation, 48% shrinking** and flagged all three.
The three numbers being identical is the diagnosis: a `-keep` blocks shrinking *and* optimization *and*
obfuscation over whatever it matches, so one set of over-broad rules moves all three together. R8 itself
had been on since ADR 012 — this was never "R8 is off", it was "R8 is not allowed to touch half the app".

R8's own keep-radius report (`configanalyzer.pb`, written by every `assembleRelease` on AGP 9.3; the
standalone task is `:app:analyzeReleaseR8Config`) named the culprits precisely. Three rules accounted for
**56,456 of the 60,652 blocked items — 93%** — and for 41.3% of the dex by size:

| rule | blocked items | dex |
|---|---|---|
| `-keep class com.google.crypto.tink.** { *; }` | 30,085 | 1.79 MB |
| `-keep class com.reandroid.** { *; }` (ARSCLib) | 23,397 | 1.42 MB |
| `-keep class com.android.apksig.** { *; }` | 2,974 | 0.20 MB |

All three were belt-and-suspenders from the ADR 012 flip, kept broad on the theory that a reflective
library is safer pinned than shrunk. None of them earned it. Tink ships the one consumer rule it actually
needs (`protobuf.pro`, `<fields>` of the shaded `GeneratedMessageLite`s) and is otherwise designed to be
shrunk: `TinkInit` calls `HybridConfig.register()` / `SignatureConfig.register()`, which reference their key
managers by static field, and `KeyTemplates.get(String)` reads the registry those calls populate rather than
doing a `Class.forName`. ARSCLib and apksig are reached only from `ui/invite/ApkMerger.kt` and
`ui/invite/ShareSigningKey.kt`, through six ordinary call sites R8 traces like any other code. Dropping all
three cost nothing and bought everything:

- rates **70.6 / 70.4 / 70.6% → 97.0 / 96.8 / 97.0%** (blocked items 60,652 → 4,744)
- dex bytes still carrying original package names **44.3% → 4.6%** (R8 full mode repackages everything it
  renames into the unnamed root package, so a real package name left in the dex *is* a keep rule's footprint)
- dex **9.90 MB → 6.03 MB**, and it stopped needing a second dex file
- APK 70.4 MB → 66.5 MB

**The xmlpull duplication bites twice, and the second bite is worse.** ADR 012 found that ARSCLib bundles a
copy of the platform package `org.xmlpull.v1` into the APK, so R8 renamed the *interface* out from under
the framework's `XmlBlock$Parser` and resource-XML inflation died with `IncompatibleClassChangeError`; the
fix was to pin `org.xmlpull.v1.**`. Pinning the names is not enough. Because the interface is a **program**
class here, R8 full mode also reasons about it under the closed-world assumption, and counts implementors.
The only ones in the APK are ARSCLib's own (`KXmlParser`, `ResXmlPullParser`) — `XmlBlock$Parser` is a
library class implementing the *library* copy of the interface, which the program copy shadows, so it does
not count. While `com.reandroid.**` was pinned wholesale, ARSCLib's implementors were trivially alive and
the question never arose. Shrink them away and R8 concludes the interface is uninhabited, every value of
that type must therefore be null, and it compiles `parser.next()` down to a literal `throw null`. Compose's
`painterResource()` then dies with a `NullPointerException` inside `seekToStartTag` on the first vector
drawable it loads — which is a chat-list avatar, so the app crashes on its first screen, having launched
and rendered onboarding perfectly. Confirmed by reading the shipped dex: `Resources.getXml()` is invoked
for its side effect and the very next instruction is `throw v3` with `v3 = null`.

The fix is one line and keeps only inhabitance, not names:

```
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowoptimization class * implements org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParser
```

R8 may still rename and optimize the implementor; it may not delete the last one. Cost: **+29 KB of dex**,
and the three rates do not move. That is the whole price of the bug.

**Verified on a minified, obfuscated `staging` build on an API-37 emulator**, because both remaining
hazards fail *silently* and a launch check proves nothing: Tink throws at `getPrimitive()` rather than at
load, and the moderators fail **open**. Checked: cold launch and render (xmlpull); `libsqlcipher.so` loads
and a sent message survives a restart (SQLCipher JNI); identity minted on first run and the contact-card QR
renders from the keyset (Tink `KeyTemplates.get` → `generateNew` → `TinkProtoKeysetFormat`, HPKE + Ed25519
public export); a genuinely abusive message is **refused** while a benign one sends (tflite text
moderation — the fail-open surface, and the one where "no crash" is the wrong signal); and Install offline
produces `Knit-2.4.0-alpha.0.apk` through the sharesheet (ARSCLib `ApkBundle`/`ApkModule` + apksig
`ApkSigner`). `missing_rules.txt` is empty and `lintRelease` is clean.

**CI now enforces it**, because the realistic regression is not someone re-adding these lines — it is a
dependency upgrade shipping a broad consumer keep rule, which is invisible in a diff and silent until the
next Play upload. `build:release` loses its `allow_failure: true`, gains `:app:analyzeReleaseR8Config`
(archived as HTML — it names the offending rule), and ends with `scripts/r8-dex-gate.sh`, which fails on a
step change in the share of dex bytes R8 was not allowed to rename. That share needs no proto parsing to
measure and no tooling the build does not already install: `apkanalyzer dex packages --defined-only`,
summed over the top-level packages that still have names. It is a coarse alarm (15%, against 4.6% today),
not a target.

Honest residuals (accepted): the **DM seal/open path is still unverified under R8** — it needs two peers
with radios, and an emulator has neither, so what has been proven is that Tink mints, stores, reloads and
exports keys correctly, not that a message round-trips; ARSCLib's `org.xmlpull.v1` copy is still shipped and
still shadows the platform's, so both keep rules stay load-bearing and a future ARSCLib bump must be
re-verified on a device rather than by reading a changelog; `net.zetetic.**` and `org.tensorflow.lite.**`
remain pinned `{ *; }` (together 1.1% of dex — the remaining slack is small enough that the fail-silent
risk is not worth taking); the baseline profile was **not** regenerated, because its rules name source
symbols that did not change and `compileReleaseArtProfile` reported none unmatched; and the 15% gate
threshold is a judgement call with no principle behind it beyond "far enough above 4.6% never to
false-alarm, far enough below 44.3% to catch this class of regression".
