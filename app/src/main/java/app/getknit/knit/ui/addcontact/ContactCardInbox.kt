 * A process-scoped, single-shot handoff for a contact link arriving from outside Compose — a tapped
 * `https://getknit.app/c#…` / `knit://c/…` link, or a shared text that contains one. Mirrors
 * [app.getknit.knit.ui.RouteInbox]: `MainActivity` [offer]s the raw text, `KnitApp` observes [pending]
 * and opens the Add-contact screen, which [consume]s it. Unlike the share/route inboxes, a card that
 * lands before onboarding is **kept** — a fresh install opened from a friend's link is the primary way a
 * card arrives, and it waits for the permission gate rather than being dropped.
