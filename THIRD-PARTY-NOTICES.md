# Third-Party Notices

Knit is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later** (see [`COPYING`](COPYING)).
It redistributes, and depends on, the third-party open-source components listed below. Every component
shipped in the Knit APK is under a **GPL-compatible** license (Apache-2.0, BSD, MIT, or the Unicode
License); the project deliberately carries **no Google Play services / GMS** dependency.

This file is provided for attribution and to satisfy the notice-retention terms of the Apache License
2.0 (§4), the BSD license, and the MIT license. Where a component ships its own `NOTICE` file, that
notice is incorporated here by reference. The full text of the Apache License 2.0 is available at
<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>.

The same list is shown in the app under **Settings › ⋮ › Open-source licenses**, each row opening the
license text bundled under `app/src/main/assets/legal/`. The in-app copy is
`app/src/main/java/app/getknit/knit/legal/ThirdPartyNotices.kt`; two tests keep the three in step —
`ThirdPartyNoticesSyncTest` pins the tables below to that list row for row, and
`ReleaseClasspathNoticesTest` pins the list to every coordinate on `app/gradle.lockfile`'s release runtime
classpath. Rows read: the component, then the project it comes from, then its SPDX license id.

QR *scanning* uses CameraX (an AndroidX library, above) plus ZXing core; the former ZXing Android Embedded
dependency was dropped when the scanner moved to CameraX.

## Bundled ML models and data

- **On-device moderation models** — the NSFW image classifier and the toxicity text classifier bundled
  under `app/src/main/assets/moderation/` are third-party works redistributed under their own licenses. The
  full notices, source URLs, and license texts are in
  [`app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md`](app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md).
- **`profanity_en.txt`** — the deterministic profanity word list under `app/src/main/assets/moderation/`
  is a derived work generated from [dsojevic/profanity-list](https://github.com/dsojevic/profanity-list)
  (MIT, © 2021 David Sojevic), pinned at commit `c27924319aa9bd6f917e3782b4f4b6604a50b652`, by

## Build- and test-only dependencies (not distributed)

The following are used only to build, lint, or test Knit and are **not** shipped in the APK, so their
licenses do not affect redistribution of the app: JUnit 4 (EPL-1.0), MockK, Robolectric, Espresso and
the AndroidX Test libraries, UIAutomator, Room testing, Koin test (all Apache-2.0), and the detekt,
ktlint, and Kover build tooling. JUnit's EPL-1.0 license is GPL-incompatible for *distribution*, but
JUnit is never distributed with Knit — it is a test-scope dependency only.

A handful of annotation-only jars (JSpecify, the Checker Framework qualifiers, JSR-305, Error Prone and
J2ObjC annotations, AutoValue annotations, JetBrains annotations) sit on the release classpath but carry no
runtime code — R8 drops every reference — so they need no notice; `ReleaseClasspathNoticesTest` lists them
as `NOT_SHIPPED` with that reason.

---

When you add, remove, or upgrade a **shipped** dependency, update this file **and** the matching row in
`app/src/main/java/app/getknit/knit/legal/ThirdPartyNotices.kt` so the attribution list stays accurate;
the two tests above fail until the table, the list and the lockfile agree (see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
