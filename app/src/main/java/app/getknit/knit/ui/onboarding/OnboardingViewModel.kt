 * Owns what the onboarding pager needs to remember across rotation and between pages: which step is showing,
 * the name being typed, and the alias that stands in for it. The permission probes and launchers are not
 * here — they need an Activity, and live with the screen (`rememberOnboardingPermissions`).
 *
 * The name is held locally and never bound to the DataStore flow (the write→emit round-trip lags a keystroke
 * and resets the field — the `ProfileViewModel` rule). It is persisted once, on leaving the name page, and the
 * same moment records [SettingsStore.onboardingSeen], so a phone that comes back to onboarding with a grant
 * revoked opens on the permissions page rather than being asked its name again. Written there rather than on
 * Start because Start pops this route with `popUpTo(inclusive = true)`, which clears this ViewModel — a write
 * launched on that tap could be cancelled mid-flight. The write itself is [NonCancellable] for the same
 * reason: a fast Continue → Start could still clear the scope before DataStore has run the edit.
