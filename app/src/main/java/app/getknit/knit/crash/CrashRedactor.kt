/**
 * Strips identifying material out of a crash report before it can be read, shared, or pasted anywhere.
 *
 * Stack **frames** pass through byte-identical. A frame's class, method, file and line are constants
 * compiled into the APK — identical on every install — so they cannot carry a node id, a contact name,
 * or message text, and they are the entire diagnostic payload. Everything else is treated as an
 * exception *message*, which is where identifiers do leak in practice: `BluetoothMeshTransport` puts
 * two node ids into one `IllegalStateException`, and `GallerySaver` puts a `content://` uri into an
 * `error()`.
 *
 * Redaction runs in **two phases**, both through this one function:
 *
 *  1. **Write time** ([redact] with [KnownSecrets.NONE]) — structural rules only. This runs inside the
 *     uncaught-exception handler, where the process is dying, Koin never started, and the SQLCipher
 *     database is unreachable.
 *  2. **Read/share time** ([redact] with a populated [KnownSecrets]) — the same rules plus an
 *     exact-match pass over the contact names this device actually knows. Names have no structure to
 *     key on, so nothing but an exact match can catch them, and the name list only exists once the
 *     database is readable again.
 *
 * Placeholders (`[node]`, `[path]`, …) match no rule, so redaction is **idempotent**: phase 2 can run
 * over a whole stored report, header included, without disturbing phase 1's output.
 *
 * What this guarantees: no structured identifier (node/group/blob/device id, safety number, key
 * material), no url token, no on-device path, no non-ASCII user content, and no message longer than
 * [MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS]. Phase 2 adds: no name known to this device. What it does **not** catch: a short,
 * ASCII string we have never stored — a group title typed by a peer, say. The report's own `redaction:`
 * line records which passes ran so a reader is never misled about which guarantee they hold.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, no Android dependencies, so the whole capture path stays unit-testable on the JVM.
