/**
 * Text, an image, and/or an arbitrary file handed to Knit from another app's share sheet (an `ACTION_SEND`
 * intent). Each stream is kept as the [String] form of its `content://` URI — re-parsing that string with
 * `Uri.parse` preserves the temporary read grant (the grant is keyed to the (uid, uri) pair, not a
 * particular `Uri` instance), and keeping it a plain string makes [ShareInbox] JVM-unit-testable.
 *
 * [imageUri] and [fileUri] are kept apart rather than folded into one field because they land in different
 * places: an image can be attached anywhere, while a file is only offered in DMs and groups (ADR
 * 2026-09.qq2r), so the destination has to be able to tell them apart and say so if it cannot take one.

 * A process-scoped, single-shot handoff for a payload arriving via the system share sheet. The

 * [app.getknit.knit.ui.chat.ChatScreen] [consume]s it into its draft. A holder is needed because
 * Compose navigation routes can't cleanly carry a `Uri` or long text.
