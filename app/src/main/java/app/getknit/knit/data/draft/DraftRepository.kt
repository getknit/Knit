/**
 * Keeps what was typed into a thread's composer, so leaving the screen doesn't throw it away.
 *
 * Two properties shape the implementation:
 *
 * **The write outlives the screen.** [scope] is the application scope, not a `viewModelScope`: the
 * whole point is that the draft survives the user navigating away, and a write started on the way out
 * would be cancelled by the very act it is meant to record. The same is true of [clear] after a send —
 * a send followed immediately by the back gesture must still leave the field empty next time.
 *
 * **One write per pause, not per keystroke.** Each edit cancels the previous pending write and schedules
 * another [debounceMs] out, so a burst of typing costs one row write once the user stops.
 *
 * Every entry point launches on [dispatcher] (the main thread in production), which is what makes the
 * pending-write map safe to touch without a lock — the callers are already on it, and Room's suspend DAO
 * functions do their SQL on the database's own dispatcher. Ordering follows from the same place: the
 * writes queue in the order they were scheduled, so the last edit wins and a [clear] is not undone by a
 * write it cancelled.
 *
 * A draft belongs to its thread and dies with it — see the [clear] callers on the delete paths.
