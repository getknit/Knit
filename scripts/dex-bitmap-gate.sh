# Guard Knit's release dex against an unbounded BitmapFactory decode.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Play Console's app-quality scan flags "BitmapFactory without downsampling" — any
# `BitmapFactory.decode*` call made without a `BitmapFactory.Options` carrying an `inSampleSize`, which
# decodes an image at whatever resolution the image itself declares. For Knit that is not a memory-hygiene
# nit but an input-validation one: avatars and attachments arrive from peers over the mesh, and while a
# blob's *byte* size is bounded its *pixel* count is not, so a small, highly compressible image decodes to
# hundreds of MB. ADR 051 moved every decode behind `data/ImageDecode.kt`; detekt's ForbiddenImport keeps
# our sources there. This is the other half — the dex sees library code too, and libraries are exactly
# where such a call arrives silently on a dependency bump.
#
# It also exists because the Play report itself is unreadable: R8 full mode merges and moves methods across
# classes, so Play's retrace named two `com.google.crypto.tink.*.<clinit>` methods for calls that are
# physically in `MessageNotifier` and `androidx.core`. Names in that report cannot be trusted; this script
# is how you get the truth, and it prints the same evidence the investigation needed.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. Every `invoke-*` of `Landroid/graphics/BitmapFactory;.decode*` in the APK's dex whose
# descriptor does NOT take a `BitmapFactory$Options`, reported with the (obfuscated) class + method that
# contains it — feed those to `retrace` against app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt, but treat
# the answer as a hint, not a fact, and read the surrounding `dexdump -d` instead.
#
# THE BUDGET is 2, and both are androidx.core's own: `IconCompat.toIcon(Context)` decodes a URI-backed icon
# on its TYPE_URI / TYPE_URI_ADAPTIVE_BITMAP branch, and `ShortcutManagerCompat.pushDynamicShortcut` inlines
# the same method. Knit only ever builds icons with `IconCompat.createWithAdaptiveBitmap(bitmap)`, so that
# branch is dead for us — but it is reachable on paper, so R8 keeps it and the scanner counts it. A third
# hit is a real regression: ours, or a new dependency's.
