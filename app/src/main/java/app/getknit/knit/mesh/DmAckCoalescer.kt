/**
 * Holds the delivery receipts we owe for DMs that arrived over a **slow plane** (the LoRa board), so that a
 * burst of messages from one author becomes one sealed `CTL_RECEIPT` and a reply we send meanwhile can carry
 * the acks for free (ADR 054).
 *
 * Why it exists: over LoRa a sealed ✓✓ costs as much air as the message it acks (~3 s of a 45-s window), and
 * `InboundPipeline` re-acks a DM on every re-delivery — so a casual conversation spent half its airtime on
 * ticks. Holding them for [holdMs] turns N ticks into one, and [take] lets the next outbound DM to that
 * author carry them inline instead.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** folded into [AckSync]: that class encodes the broadcast/group rules (ADR 033/053 — a
 * live-link form, verbatim retries, a done-ledger). A DM tick has none of those: nothing retries it (it is
 * custodied once), and re-acking on re-delivery is the LoRa healing channel (ADR 039 §3), so there is no
 * ledger to keep. Only the debounce shape is shared, and it is mirrored here in style rather than reused.
 *
 * In-memory only, like AckSync's ledger: a process death inside the hold loses the pending acks, and the
 * peer's next LoRa re-offer (or any custody re-serve) re-delivers the DM, which re-holds and re-ticks it.
 * Pure — [now] and [flushScope] are injected; the JVM tests drive it on a virtual clock.
