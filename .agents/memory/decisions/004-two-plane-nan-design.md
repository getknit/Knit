# ADR 004 — Two-plane NAN design (cue plane + ephemeral NDP) with an accept-any responder

Status: Accepted · Re-audited 2026-07-04 (`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`)

`maxNdiInterfaces == 1` is per-*role*: a single accept-any responder multiplexes many inbound NDPs, but
each initiator needs its own NDI. So coordination rides Wi-Fi Aware messages (no data path) and data rides
one ephemeral NDP brought up only for a digest-differing peer. Per-peer responders don't compose. Detail:
`context/mesh-transport.md`. A concurrent-serve redesign is proposed in
`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §5.
