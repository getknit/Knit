/**
 * Arms the two planes an emulator cannot actually run — the Internet relays and the LoRa board — for the
 * demo builds. Shared by the static seeder ([DemoSeeder]) and the animated trailer ([DemoDirector]) for the
 * same reason [DemoWriter] is: both need a chat header wearing the globe and the board glyph, and a
 * settings screen with something in it, and neither may open a socket or dial a board to get there.
 *
 * The state is *reported*, never real. Each plane has two halves and they are armed differently on purpose:
 *
 * - The **settings** (relay list, consent, the bound board and its setup record) are genuine `SettingsStore`
 *   writes, so the two settings screens photograph their real controls in their real states.
 * - The **live status** is pinned — spools through [MeshManager.seedDemoSpools], the board through
 *   [app.getknit.knit.mesh.DemoLoraPlane] — because a demo build holds no `ScopeSync` session and no board
 *   link, and both report "nothing here", which is exactly the state a capture must not be of.
 *
 * Theme-independent, like [DemoSeeder.ONLINE_NODE_IDS]: a relay URL and a Heltec's node number read the
 * same at a trailhead and on the playa, so neither belongs in a [DemoScenario].
