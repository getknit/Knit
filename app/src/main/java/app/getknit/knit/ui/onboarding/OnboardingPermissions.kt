 * `Context` lives here rather than in the ViewModel, in the `rememberLocationGate` / `MicGate` idiom.
 *
 * The probes are re-read on every launcher result **and** on every resume: the system permission dialog,
 * the battery dialog and the app-info Settings page are all separate activities, so coming back from any of
 * them is an `ON_RESUME` on this back-stack entry — which is what flips a row to "Allowed" after the user
 * granted it in Settings. `asked` survives rotation (`rememberSaveable`) but not process death; a fresh
 * process that lost it self-heals on the next tap (an instant refusal callback sets it again), which is one
 * wasted tap and not worth a DataStore key.
