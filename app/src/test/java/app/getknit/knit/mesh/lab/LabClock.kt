/**
 * One calendar for the whole lab: the wall clock plus a jump every node shares, so the nodes always agree
 * with each other — the property `spaced {}` and ADR 2026-09.gdhp rely on ("the wall clock every peer
 * shares") — while a scenario can move the date past a floor the field waits minutes or days for (the
 * router's 10-min seen window, the 15-min seed floor, the 24 h custody TTL, the 48 h intro grace).
 *
 * A jump moves *decisions* — expiry, floors, last-writer-wins, tombstones, presence — never *schedulers*:
 * every periodic loop is `delay()`-based and blind to it, so a scenario that jumped pokes the work itself
 * (`LabNode.heal()`, `sweepLocalStorage()`, a re-link for the digest exchange, a fresh send). Forward only:
 * `SeenSet`, the LoRa plane's restored state and the profile reflood floor all assume time never runs back.
 *
 * [skew] is the one seam to a *disagreeing* clock, for a scenario that originates a far-future frame: a
 * skew past `Protocol.MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_MS` is exactly what trips the custody refusal and `clampFuture`.
