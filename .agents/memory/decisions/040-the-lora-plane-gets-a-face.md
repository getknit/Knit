# ADR 040 — The LoRa plane gets a face: an arrival plane per message, a header glyph, a board-only picker

Status: Accepted (2026-08-25; `InboundFrame.kind`, `DeliveryPlane.LoRa`, `mesh/lora/LoraPlane.kt`,
`LoraStatusRepository`, `BoardFilter`, `ui/chat/LoraReach.kt`, `LoraSizeHint`)

ADR 038/039 shipped a plane the app could not see: a message that crossed the board was stored as
`DeliveryPlane.Nearby`, the connection header had no LoRa glyph where the Internet plane has its cloud, and
the LoRa screen offered every bonded Bluetooth device as a board. This lands the presentation layer by
mirroring the Internet plane's existing shapes rather than inventing new ones. Decisions worth not
relitigating:

1. **`InboundFrame.kind` reverses 038 §3's "`TransportKind` is diagnostics-only" — for presentation only.**
   `CompositeMeshTransport` stamps each child's kind on the frames it merges (the one place that knows;
   `FramedLink` is shared by BLE and NAN and cannot), the router hands it to `InboundPipeline.onDeliver`, and
   `planeOf(fromNodeId, kind)` maps a board frame to the new `DeliveryPlane.LoRa` (code 5). The phone radios
   still collapse to `Nearby` on purpose (the UI has nothing different to say about them). ADR 019's rule
   stands: carry, relay and convergence never read the kind; `MeshRouter` only forwards it. The plane is never
   encoded into `fromNodeId` — that feeds split horizon and reply addressing. `PendingInbound` keeps the kind
   through the key-bootstrap replay, which LoRa relies on (a DM heard before the sender's beacon).
2. **An inbound row is first-write-wins (`MessageDao.insertIfAbsent`), not an upsert.** The plaintext room
   path bypasses the exists-gate and re-ran `deliverChat`'s upsert on every custody re-serve; its comment argued
   the plane it rewrote was always the same "because the room never crosses the Internet" — false once LoRa is
   a plane, since the room is exactly what LoRa carries. A re-served frame is identical signed bytes and can
   never carry anything new, while the upsert also wiped the voice-note metadata `setVoiceMeta` adds after the
   insert and, for our own room post looping back after the SeenSet lapsed, reset its ✓✓ to ✓. Blob re-pull and
   the typing clear still run on a re-serve (they sit after the persist). The v2 hooks stay on `save` (they are
   exists-gated and commit with the ratchet delta).
3. **The header glyph mirrors the cloud exactly.** `LoraPlane { Off, Down, Live }` is the board's `RelayPlane`,
   folded by a *pushed* `LoraStatusRepository` (the transport's status is already a `StateFlow`; no ticker) into
   `LoraFacts(plane, dms)` — one injected flow, not two, because a second never-emitting relaxed mock stalls
   every ViewModel test. `Icons.Outlined.Sensors`/`SensorsOff` (the only radio glyph with an off variant, needed
   for the colour-blind-safe Down state) sit after the cloud; the label is never rewritten — a board needs this
   phone's Bluetooth, so "radios off but LoRa live" cannot happen, and a LoRa-heard peer already counts in the
   mesh line. The Down edge waits 45 s, not the cloud's 12: the session reconnects on a 5 s-and-up backoff and a
   Knit-channel write reboots the board on purpose.
4. **The transport's UI face is a seam (`LoraPlaneStatus`), bound to the transport only when the build ships
   the plane and to a dark stand-in otherwise.** `MeshModule` promises release never instantiates the
   GATT/session singletons; a repository resolved by every open chat would have, through `get<LoraMeshTransport>()`.
5. **The picker's board verdict is a heuristic with an escape hatch, never a filter that drops.** A device is
   board-like when LE-capable and named `Meshtastic_xxxx`, or `<short>_xxxx` (a renamed board — the firmware
   keeps the four MAC hex digits), or carrying the Meshtastic service UUID in the stack's cache (positive-only;
   the cache is empty for most LE bonds). `BoardFilter` shows those plus the bound board; the rest are counted
   behind "Show all paired devices". The bonded list is a Binder call, read on its own arm (resume, the toggle,
   a bound-address change) — never on link churn, which it was.
6. **A connected board earns a channel verdict.** The selected slot's *name* is shown ("Channel 1 · Knit") and
   a slot that is not `KnitChannel.NAME` — index 0, the unnamed primary, included — is flagged with the
   "Set up Knit channel" button emphasized: both boards must be provisioned before a frame crosses, and this
   was the setup step most people still owed.
7. **A DM whose peer only the board has heard gets a pinned notice, like the relay notice.** `LoraReach`
   reads `peerTransports[peer] == {LoRa}` with the plane live and the thread not relay-covered (a covered DM
   has a better carrier); a `LoraOnlyDmsOff` variant says nothing reaches them while the switch is off. The
   copy says "last heard" — the plane's reachable set lingers 45 min. The room and groups never render it.
8. **The composer's "long message" hint is sized by body budgets pinned against real frames.**
   `LoraSizeHint` (room 400 B, session-initial DM 320 B, minus 260 B for a quoted reply and 170 B for an
   attachment reference) sits below the true ceilings, and `CoordinationPlaneSizeBudgetTest` builds frames at
   exactly those sizes — deflate-hostile bodies, the largest reply, an attachment ref — and checks they fit in
   ≤ 3 packets, so the hint can under-warn but never over-promise. Shown only when the draft would ride LoRa
   (`LoraCarry`: the room, or a DM with private messages over LoRa on; never a group), read off the draft
   in the composer via `derivedStateOf` so it recomposes on threshold crossings, not per keystroke.

Not a wire change, no migration (`receivedVia` existed since DB v4; a new code), custody untouched; old
builds read code 5 as `Unknown` → "arrived nearby". Deferred, still: an in-app scan + bond flow
(`MeshtasticScanner`/`MeshtasticBonder` are written but unwired — device-only verifiable, and the scan must go
through `BleConnectArbiter`), and a per-message marker for a post that was `loraTooBig` (no persisted
evidence; the composer hint covers the sending side). Surfaces + tags: `context/lora-bridge.md`.
