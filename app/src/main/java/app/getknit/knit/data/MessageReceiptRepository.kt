/**
 * Single source of truth for *who* has received a message — the per-acker rows behind the message-details
 * screen's "delivered to / waiting on" split.
 *
 * It owns the delivery write outright: [record] flips the shared tick on `messages` **and** stores the
 * acker in one transaction, so the aggregate ✓✓ and the per-recipient list can never disagree (the
 * "multi-step data-layer mutations are transactional" rule — the send and receive paths write these
 * tables from different coroutines). It wraps [MessageRepository] rather than extending it, the
 * [GroupRepository] idiom, so the widely-constructed message repository keeps its signature.
 *
 * Nothing here is wire state: see [MessageReceiptEntity] for why storing the acker changes no frame,
 * no digest, and no delivery semantic.
