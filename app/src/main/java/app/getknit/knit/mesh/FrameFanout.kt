 * Whether [env] should *also* ride the [MeshTransport.fastFanout] coordination-plane fast path — a
 * best-effort fan-out to every neighbor at once with **no data path** — on top of the normal flood and
 * store-and-forward custody. It's for small, flood-to-everyone frames: the plaintext broadcast room plus the
 * cleartext metadata frames (reactions, delivery receipts, group roster updates/leaves, profiles) — exactly
 * the non-chat [FrameType.isCustodial] types. In an idle cue-driven mesh no NDP is up, so a plain flood
 * reaches the ≤1 live neighbor (usually zero); the fast path delivers to every neighbor at once and custody
 * backstops any peer that was away. Reused on both origination (`originateSigned`) and relay (`onDeliver`),
 * so a frame hops the mesh at message-plane speed rather than only one hop from the originator. E2E DM/group
 * *chat* frames are excluded (the broadcast-only arm): they carry wrapped keys and won't fit the ~255 B
 * channel, so they ride the NDP flood + custody. The transport still size-gates (no-op if a frame won't
 * fit), and the receiver's SeenSet dedups any copy that also arrives over the flood/custody backstop.

/**
 * Whether [env] should *also* ride [MeshTransport.fastSend] — the **targeted** coordination-plane sibling of
 * [shouldFastFanout], admitting exactly the DM-form chat frames that one excludes. Targeted, never fanned:
 * one send to the addressee, so a sealed frame is not sprayed at neighbors with no business holding it and
 * the ~255 B channel carries one copy rather than N.
 *
 * The size reasoning [shouldFastFanout] gives for excluding this form ("won't fit the ~255 B channel") does
 * not survive contact with the rest of the tree: `AckSync` already sends **sealed receipts** over
 * [MeshTransport.fastSend], and a sealed receipt is wire-indistinguishable from a real DM (ADR 016/018) —
 * same type, same recipient, same sealed payload. The transport compacts and fragments to
 * `FastFrameCodec.MAX_PARTS`, so the real budget is ~753 B, which covers a short-to-medium DM; anything
 * larger fails the encoder's size gate and no-ops back onto custody, exactly as today.
 *
 * Why it matters: with no NDP and no Bluetooth a node's broadcast room chat still flows over this plane
 * while every DM, group-key seed and `CTL_GROUP_KEY_REQ` — all this same form — sits undeliverable in its
 * own custody with the peer sitting in `cueTarget` the whole time (three-Pixel capture, 2026-09-07;
 * ADR 2026-09.9dnk). Same set as [shouldLongRangeFanout] by construction, and for the same reason: on a
 * plane with no data path, fan-out is the only path a frame can take. Kept as two predicates rather than
 * one shared helper because they answer different questions about different planes, and will drift apart
 * the first time one plane's budget changes.
 *
 * Best-effort and unacknowledged, like the rest of the fast path — a latency layer over the NDP flood +
 * custody, never a replacement for it, and the receiver's SeenSet drops whichever copy loses the race.
