/**
 * Where a **dedicated** Knit fleet parks its radio (ADR 067) — a debug-only alternative to ADR 045's default,
 * which deliberately leaves the board on the stock public frequency so strangers' nodes relay Knit for free.
 *
 * That bargain is the right one wherever there is a Meshtastic community to borrow, and worthless where there
 * is not: an isolated farm or a mountain house has no organic boards to repeat anything, so sharing the public
 * slot buys nothing and costs the politeness ceiling `LoraAirtime` applies for the neighbours' sake. On a slot
 * of its own a household fleet is alone on the air, and the only limit that still means anything is the
 * region's legal duty cycle — see [LoraAirtime.allowanceMs].
 *
 * **The slot is computed, not configured.** Meshtastic derives its RF slot from `hash(primary channel name) %
 * numChannels` whenever `channel_num` is 0; pinning `channel_num` instead means Knit picks the transmit
 * frequency, so a slot past the end of the band is out-of-band transmission rather than a bug. Hence the two
 * rules here: the count comes from the band the region actually has ([LoraRegion.bandWidthKhz]) at the
 * board's own preset bandwidth, and a region whose band Knit does not know **exactly** gets no slot at all
 * ([forRegion] returns null and the setup refuses). Deriving it from [KnitChannel.NAME] rather than asking
 * the user keeps ADR 045's best property intact within the dedicated fleet: two Knit boards in the same
 * region on the same preset land on the same slot with no coordination at all.
 *
 * Pure; pinned by `LoraSlotTest`.
